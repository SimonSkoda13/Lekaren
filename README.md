Throughout the development of the two homepage versions for the pharmacy using Next.js, I gained invaluable insights and skills that have significantly broadened my understanding of web development.

### Key techiques :rocket: :

1. **Design Adaptability**: Crafting two distinct design versions taught me the importance of flexible and adaptable UI/UX design in web development. I learned to consider various design elements like color schemes, layout structures, and user interaction patterns.

2. **Next.js Proficiency**: Working with Next.js, I enhanced my skills in this framework. I learned to efficiently manage routes, components, and styles, providing a seamless user experience while maintaining a clean codebase.

3. **Client-Centric Development**: This project underscored the importance of understanding and incorporating client feedback into the development process. It helped me improve my ability to translate client needs into functional designs.

4. **Responsive Design Techniques**: I honed my skills in creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience across all platforms.

5. **Project Management**: Balancing two different design versions while adhering to deadlines improved my project management skills, including time management, task prioritization, and iterative development.

## Client Decisions

After reviewing both homepage versions, the client made some key decisions:

1. **Design Choice**: The client preferred the modern and minimalistic approach of Version 2. They felt this design aligned better with their vision of presenting the pharmacy as a forward-thinking and user-friendly establishment.

2. **Feature Integration**: Based on user feedback, the client decided to integrate certain elements from Version 1 into Version 2, such as the traditional navigation bar, which users found more intuitive.

3. **Focus on Mobile Responsiveness**: Recognizing the increasing trend of mobile users, the client emphasized the need for a highly responsive mobile version of the homepage.

4. **Future Updates**: The client expressed interest in regularly updating the website to keep up with design trends and user preferences, indicating a long-term engagement with the project.

## Conclusion

This project was not only a journey in technical development but also an exercise in client engagement and adaptive design. The skills and experiences gained from this project are invaluable and will undoubtedly influence my approach to future web development projects.
